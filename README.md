# A collection of technical challenges

This is a collection of technical challenges that I and others have got when applying for jobs.  The concept is to have a repo where people can get an idea of the kind of technical challenge they can expect.

PRs welcome.  I'll do contributing guidelines at some point, but when submitting a test please make sure you include the job title of the position applied for and any tech expected to be used.  Also remove any information about the company that has set the task.
