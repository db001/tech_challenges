This project was built using [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) as a task runner to transpile ES6 (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) and to compile Sass.

Front end development code can be found in the `client/src` folder, and transpiled/compiled code is in the `client/dist` folder.

#### Prerequisites:

To run:

-   PHP installed and added to path

For development:

-   Grunt installed globally (`npm i -g grunt`)
